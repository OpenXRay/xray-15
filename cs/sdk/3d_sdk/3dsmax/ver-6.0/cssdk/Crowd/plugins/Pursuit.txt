Pursuit Behavior.
Behavior Description.

The Pursuit behavior lets you specify an object as a target for delegates to pursue.  It is similar to the Seek behavior in this respect.  However, the delegates, instead of seeking the target at its current position, they will seek a position ahead of the target, based upon the target's speed and it's distance from the delegate.

Procedure.

To Use The Pursuit Behavior.

First of all, since the Pursuit behavior is an example demonstrating the use of Crowd SDK, it originally won't be present as a useable behavior.  In order to use the Pursuit Behavior from within crowd, the pursuit.dlc file needs to be in your 'plugin' directory path.  

Then,

1. Add a Pursuit behavior to the Crowd object.
2. In the Pursuit behavior rollout, use the -None- button to designate an object to be sought.
3. Change the default settings as desired.
4. Use BehaviorAssignments to assign the behavior to a delegate or team.

Interface.

None(label).  Specifies a single target.  Click this button, and then click the target object in the viewport.  The target's name then appears on the button.

Color Swatch (1st).  Shows the color used to draw the target icon.  Click the button to select a different color. Default = dark blue.

Display Target.  Enables display of the target icon, the location where the delegate is seeking, while the simulation is running.

Target Scale.  Specifies the overall size of the target icon.  Default = 5.0.

Color Swatch (2nd).  Shows the color used to draw the Pursuit force vector during the solution.  Click the button to select a different color.  Default = light green.
